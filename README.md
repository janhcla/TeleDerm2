# TeleDerm2

I'm coding an ios app that lets the user take one or more photos, rename and convert them to jpeg, and then upload them to a WebDAV server on a local network.

The app is written mainly to aid a GP doctor to document skin conditions and diseases, and to aid the GP in requesting help from a Dermatologist when needed.

Thank you.
